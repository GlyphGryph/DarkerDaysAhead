Title: Suburban Prelude

Description: Enjoy a quaint day in suburbia. Surely, nothing could go wrong on such a beautiful day, especially for a person like yourself. Suddenly, the sirens begin to wail, and your humble abode is under assault from all sides! Can you survive?

Goal: A small, static map the player can move around and fight monsters that spawn while trying to survive

✓ = insert->ctrl-v + u2713

Tasks:
✓- Local World (single screen), initially blank
✓- Character
✓- Player Driven Movement of Character
  ✓- Detect movement keypresses
  ✓- Player can move cardinal
  ✓- Player cannot move past edge of map
  ✓- Player can move diagonal
  ✓- Player starts on map
✓- Kreks spawn from edges of map
  ✓- Spawn in a specific square
  ✓- Spawn in a random unoccupied square alone the edge
  ✓- Spawned Manually with a keypress, not a timing issue
  ✓- Make sure only the player character moves
✓- If player moves onto Krek, game over
  ✓- Resets the grid
  ✓- Displays "You died. Starting new game." message
✓- Kreks move around randomly
  ✓- Implement time progression (every time a player moves, process time events)
  ✓- Specifically, implement an "turn order" populated by spawned creatures
  ✓- Process turns until it is the player's turn then return to normal app control
  ✓- When a creature takes a turn, move them to the end of the turn queu
  ✓- On a Krek's turn, have the Krek move in a random direction
  ✓- If Krek moves on to player, game over
  ✓- BUGFIX: Figure out why Players don't get to all their turns
✓- Control more than one character
  ✓- Different keys for spawning enemies and allies
  ✓- Modify the control character logic so multiple can be controlled
  ✓- If not already done, make sure creatures know they are explicitly controlled
  ✓- Make sure that when the player takes an action it goes to the correct character
 - Game over when all player characters die instead of first touch
   - Instead of touching a player character be a game over, remove them from the map
   - Game over only when all of them are removed
   - Do not actually move the character doing the touching
   - Describe it as an "attack" instead
 - Enemies move "towards" player when possible
   - random square from those closest to closet player character
 - Highlight currently active player character
 - Add "terrain" of various sorts, nonfunctional
 - Add "boundary zones" that can display walls and triggers
   - This is big and important!
   - Put walls *between* moveable.
   - Players cannot move between cells that have blocking walls between them
   - L shaped walls should not allow players to move
 - Walls and blocking terrain prevent player from moving onto that space (blocking) or through it (wall)
 - Get performance acceptable
✓- Performance improved for map rendering
   ✓- Make sure cells only rerender when they change
   ✓- Don't worry too much - eventually this will all be moving to Canvas!
 - Performance improved for map rendering 2
    - Map only renders anything at beginning of players turn
    - Map STILL only renders things that changed
 - Go up and down stairs, multiple levels, drop between levels
 - Enemies will actually follow across levels if they can see you, otherwise wander randomly
 - Enemies have "hunting patterns" that make them explore
 - Holes in floor, enemies falling through them are crippled
   - If falling 2 levels, they are killed.
   - If falling onto a corpse, damage reduced by one level
          (killed -> crippled, crippled -> unhurt)
 - Inventory, the ability to pick up and put down an item
 - Items spawn randomly around map as time progresses
 - Instead of dying to crippled enemies, kill them if you have a weapon
 - Can move enemy corpses
 - Furniture. You can move it around! Close and open doors and curtains too.
 - Enemies can bash down doors and break through windows
 - Player can use supplies to fix doors and board up windows and cover holes.
 - Enemies will not move over holes in the floor they can see
   - Have to be "covered" or behind furniture/windows or otherwise obscured
   - Enemies breaking open doors move into the space on the other side, fall through hole
   - Some enemies "charge" in which case doors can be opened and they will still fall in
 - Player can make their own holes in the floor with tools.
 - Final touches - Add enemy variety, constrain spawn events, develop escalation
 - It's time - switch to canvas rendering! Otherwise this will all be super slos
